            Git (/ɡɪt/) is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in 
            any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers 
            who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Git is known for its ease of learning, small footprint, and fast performance, 
            surpassing other version control systems like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.
             It excels in areas such as inexpensive local branching, practical staging areas, and 
             accommodating various workflows

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Git's goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows 
              (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).
              Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, 
              with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Git's adoption has grown rapidly, becoming the most popular distributed version control system, 
              with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022. 
              It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers.
              There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.

            <li>
              Decentralized Version Control System: Git is a decentralized version control system, 
              which means that every user has a full copy of the project's history on their local 
              machine. This allows for offline work and makes it easier to collaborate with others.
            </li>
            <li>Branching and Merging: Git allows for easy branching and merging, which makes it an 
              ideal tool for managing complex projects with multiple developers.</li>
            <li>
              Staging Area: Git has a staging area, which allows users to select specific changes to 
              commit, rather than committing all changes at once. This can be useful for organizing and
              managing changes.

            HTML is a markup language used to structure and give meaning to content on the web.
             It is the foundation of web development and is used to create the structure or blueprint 
             of web documents. The basics of HTML include learning HTML tags, attributes, elements, and 
             document structure, which collectively form a working web page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some basic HTML tags include html, head, title, and body, which divide the whole page 
              into various parts like head, body, etc. HTML tags are not case-sensitive and are enclosed in 
             and. A tag should have an opening tag and a closing tag, with the closing tag having a forward 
              slash before the element's name. Some common beginner mistakes in HTML include not including a closing 
              tag, improper nesting, and mixing single and double quotes in attributes. HTML entities can be used to display 
              special characters, and emoji can be displayed in HTML using Unicode characters.

          HTML 5 is the 5th Global standardisation of HTML (hypertext markup language) for the internet. 
          It is the code that all of your web pages are written in and that tells your web browser what a 
          given page should look like. The last time there was a global standardisation was in 1997.
          <p>here's an example of a HTML5 code:</p>

        <p>
          CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the look and
           formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It is a cornerstone technology of the World 
           Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation 
           and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS rules consist of a selector, which specifies the HTML element(s) to which the rule applies, and a 
          declaration block, which contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes 
          a property name and a value, separated by a colon. CSS supports a wide range of properties and values, allowing 
          for extensive customization of the appearance of HTML documents.
        </p>
      </p>Here's an example of a CSS code:<p>
      <code> p {
        font-size: 16px;
        color: black; } </code>

        <header>Introduction to JavaScript</header>
        <article> JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a variety of purposes.
          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make 
            web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is lightweight and interpreted, making it faster 
            than other languages. It is integrated with HTML, allowing for the creation of dynamic
            web pages that can respond to user input without requiring a page refresh.
          </p>
         
          <p>
            Here's an example of a simple JavaScript script:
          </p>

        <code>javascript
        alert("Hello, World!");</code>

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the look and 
            formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is responsible for how a webpage looks,
            from the font size and color to the layout and spacing. It was developed to solve the problem of 
            maintaining consistent styles across different pages by separating the content of a webpage from
            its presentation
          </p>

          <p>
            Mastering CSS is an essential step towards becoming a proficient web designer. With its ability to style 
            and layout webpages, CSS offers a world of possibilities for creating visually compelling and user-friendly 
            sites.
          </p>
        </p> Here's an example of Cascading Style Sheet code: </p>
          <code>p {
            font-size: 16px;
            color: #333;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

        <header>Using External Style Sheets</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            External style sheets are used to style multiple HTML pages with a single style sheet. 
            They contain a separate CSS file with a .css extension that is linked to the HTML file using the
            'link' element within the HTML file's 'head' section. The rel attribute is set to "stylesheet" and 
            the href attribute specifies the CSS file's path. This allows for improved maintainability, enhanced reusability 
            across multiple HTML files, efficient caching, and faster page load times.

        <article>
          The Internet Protocol (IP) is a key protocol in the Internet protocol suite, responsible 
          for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into datagrams, and routing datagrams 
          from a source host interface to a destination host interface. IP is a connectionless datagram 
          service, and it is the network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol suites.

          <p>IP has two main components: the header and the payload. The header includes a source IP address, 
            a destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram. The payload 
            is the data that is transported. IP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated 
            parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into subnets, involving the designation
            of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function 
            is to transport packets across network boundaries.</p>
